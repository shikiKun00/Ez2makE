                            Onigiri is a traditional Japanese rice ball, often
                            shaped into a triangle or cylinder. It is typically
                            wrapped in nori (seaweed) and may have a filling
                            such as pickled plum (umeboshi), salted salmon, or
                            other ingredients.

                                        1. Cook the Japanese rice until done.
                                        Allow the rice to cool slightly so it is
                                        warm but manageable to handle.

                                        sprinkle a bit of salt on your palms.
                                        Take a handful of rice and shape it into
                                        a triangle or round ball, according to
                                        your preference.

                                        3. Attach a strip of nori to the bottom
                                        of the onigiri.
                                    </p>

                            Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made from a
                            stock called "dashi," which is combined with miso
                            paste (fermented soybean paste). It often includes
                            ingredients like tofu, seaweed, and green onions.
                            Miso soup is commonly served as a side dish in
                            Japanese cuisine.

                            onions that have been simmered in a mildly sweet
                            sauce made from soy sauce, mirin, and dashi. The

                                        from one side to the other using

                                        pan and let it cool slightly before

                            Karaage is a Japanese cooking technique where
                            bite-sized pieces of meat, usually chicken, are
                            marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger,
                            and sometimes other seasonings like sake or mirin.

                            vegetables, marinated beef (or other proteins), a
                            fried egg, and gochujang. The dish is mixed
                            thoroughly before eating, blending the flavors and
                            textures of the ingredients.

                            Japchae is a popular Korean dish made from
                            stir-fried glass noodles (made from sweet potato
                            starch), mixed with various vegetables such as
                            spinach, carrots, mushrooms, and onions. It's often
                            flavored with soy sauce, sesame oil, and a bit of
                            sugar.

                            BBQ ribs are a popular American dish made from pork
                            or beef ribs that are slow-cooked and then coated
                            with a flavorful barbecue sauce. The ribs are
                            typically seasoned with a dry rub before being
                            smoked, grilled, or baked, which makes the meat
                            tender and imbued with a rich, smoky flavor.
