                                        Allow the rice to cool slightly so it is
                                        warm but manageable to handle.
                                    </p>

                                        sprinkle a bit of salt on your palms.
                                        Take a handful of rice and shape it into
                                        a triangle or round ball, according to
                                        your preference.

                                        3. Attach a strip of nori to the bottom
                                        of the onigiri.
                                    </p>

                                        1. In a bowl, beat the eggs and add
                                        dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Mix
                                        well.

                                        2. Heat a rectangular tamago pan (or a
                                        regular frying pan) over medium heat and
                                        lightly oil it. Pour a thin layer of the
                                        egg mixture into the pan, tilting to
                                        spread it evenly. Add a small amount of
                                        chopped red bell pepper if desired.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        3. When the egg starts to set, roll it
                                        from one side to the other using
                                        chopsticks or a spatula. Push the rolled
                                        egg to one side of the pan and pour
                                        another thin layer of egg mixture into
                                        the pan, lifting the rolled egg to let
                                        the uncooked egg flow underneath.

                                        4. Repeat the process until all the egg
                                        mixture is used, creating a
                                        multi-layered omelette. Remove from the
                                        pan and let it cool slightly before
                                        slicing.

                                        2. In a bowl, lightly beat the egg and
                                        mix with ice-cold water.

                                        3. Add the flour to the egg mixture and
                                        stir lightly until just combined. Do not
                                        overmix; the batter should be lumpy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        4. Lightly coat the shrimp in flour,
                                        then dip them into the batter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        5. Fry the shrimp in small batches until
                                        golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes.
                                    </p>

                                        6. Remove and drain on paper towels.
                                        Sprinkle with a little salt. After that
                                        serve hot with the dipping sauce made by
                                        combining soy sauce, mirin, and dashi.

                                        1. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce,
                                        sake, grated ginger, and grated garlic.
                                        Add the chicken pieces to the marinade,
                                        mixing well to coat. Let it marinate for
                                        at least 30 minutes.

                                        dish. Dredge each piece of marinated
                                        chicken in the potato starch, ensuring
                                        an even coating.

                                        4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot
                                        to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Fry the chicken pieces
                                        in batches until they are golden brown
                                        and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes
                                        per batch. Transfer the fried chicken to
                                        a wire rack or paper towels to drain
                                        excess oil.

                                        1. Place the chicken pieces in a large
                                        bowl or ziplock bag and pour the
                                        buttermilk over them. Make sure all
                                        pieces are well-coated.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        2. Cover the bowl or seal the bag and
                                        refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
                                        overnight for best results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        3. In a large bowl, combine the flour,
                                        salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic
                                        powder, onion powder, and cayenne
                                        pepper.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        4. Mix well to ensure the spices are
                                        evenly distributed.
                                    </p>

                                        5. Remove the chicken pieces from the
                                        buttermilk, letting any excess drip off.
                                    </p>

                                        6. Dredge each piece in the flour
                                        mixture, pressing the flour onto the
                                        chicken to create a thick, even coating.
                                        Place the coated pieces on a plate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        7. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or
                                        deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil to
                                        submerge the chicken pieces. Heat the
                                        oil to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        8. Working in batches to avoid
                                        overcrowding, carefully place the coated
                                        chicken pieces into the hot oil.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        9. Fry the chicken until it is golden
                                        brown and crispy, about 10-15 minutes
                                        per piece, depending on size. Use a meat
                                        thermometer to ensure the internal
                                        temperature reaches 165¬∞F (74¬∞C).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        10. Transfer the fried chicken to a wire
                                        rack set over a baking sheet to drain
                                        any excess oil.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        11. Allow the chicken to rest for a few
                                        minutes before serving. Enjoy your
                                        crispy, delicious fried chicken!

                            BBQ ribs are a popular American dish made from
                            <span>pork or beef ribs</span> that are slow-cooked
                            and then coated with a
                            <span>flavorful barbecue sauce</span>. The ribs are
                            typically seasoned with a dry rub before being
                            smoked, grilled, or baked, which makes the meat
                            tender and imbued with a rich, smoky flavor.
